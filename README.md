#Building Web Applications with Angular.js

It seems like everybody is talking about Angular these days.  They just released version 1.3 in October and version 2.0 is looming somewhere out there on the horizon.  In this talk we will set up an Angular.js application in ASP.net MVC using Visual Studio.  Then we will build out the functionality of a working flash card application.
